## Use in Curriculum

For more information, see [Supplementary Materials for Radiation and Atomic Literacy for Nonscientists](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2013/10/23/342.6157.436.DC1/123003-Johnson-SM.pdf)

The Atom Builder simulator allows students to build any atom up to element 105 (Dubnium) and observe its behaviors. 

Ionization is deliberately separated from radioactivity until students are clear on what an ion is and isn't. With the secret access code students can then test unstable atoms. **(Secret code: click 10 times on the gnome's face!)**

I wrote this application when I was a little kid! So I'm sorry about the poor naming conventions and code quality.
